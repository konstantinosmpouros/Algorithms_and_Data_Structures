# Algorithms and Data Structures in Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I delve into the intricate world of algorithms and data structures, exclusively using Python. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for Python implementations of various algorithms and data structures, each organized within its own directory.

## About

The purpose of this repository is to document my personal exploration and mastery over the core concepts of algorithms and data structures using Python. It includes a wide array of problems, from classic algorithmic challenges to intricate data structure implementations, all aimed at providing a deeper understanding of how efficient solutions can be devised using Python.

## Repository Structure

Each directory within this repository is dedicated to a specific algorithm or problem, containing its Python implementation 

Each directory aims to not just provide code, but also to explain the thought process, and the scenario of the implementation in order to better understand each step.

## Using This Repository

Feel free to browse through the directories, read the explanations, and run the Python scripts to see the algorithms and data structures in action. This repository is meant to be a learning tool, so I encourage you to experiment with the code and use it as a basis for your own projects or studies.

## Contact

If you have questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss the algorithms and data structures covered in this repository, please feel free to send me an email: kostasbouros@hotmail.gr
